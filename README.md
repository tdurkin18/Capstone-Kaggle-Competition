## Dataset
This dataset consists of Covid-19 related tweets posted  by users coming  from six  English-speaking  countries:  Australia,  Canada,  Ireland,  New  Zealand,  the  United  Kingdom, and the United States.  A total of 6 columns were provided, but only the tweet text and country were used to train the models. </br>
